      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Diana and I am a high school student. I own B2 level English competence and am a beginner French and German learner. I am interested in most humanistic disciplines such as art, history, literature and philosophy, currently working on building IT and coding skills. I have critical thinking, speaking and writing aptitudes, Iâ€™m well-organized and a fast-learner, but also an open and reliable person.
      <br>
      <br>
      I hope to learn a bit about everything throughout high school, involve in different kinds of projects and, one day, hopefully, get the chance to study abroad.
